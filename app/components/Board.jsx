          <h1>
            Thank you for playing Parody Minesweeper: the Unwinnable Challenge!
          </h1>
          <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to the parody version of the classic game{" "}
              <em>Minesweeper</em>. In this twisted take on the original, we've
              flipped the rules on their head. Traditionally, the first move in
              Minesweeper is always a "safe move," ensuring that you can't lose
              right off the bat. However, in this version, you are destined to
              lose on the first turn every single time.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The Concept</h2>
            <p>
              The goal of this parody game is simple: make you think you're
              playing a normal game of Minesweeper while secretly ensuring you
              lose from the very beginning. The humor lies in the eventual
              realization that no matter what you do, victory is impossible.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>First Move is Always a Loss:</strong> Unlike the
                original game, your first move will always result in a loss.
                Every time. The system is intentionally rigged against you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Randomly Generated Boards:</strong> Each turn, the board
                is randomly generated to maintain the illusion of fairness. The
                numbers that typically indicate how many mines are nearby are
                purely decorative in this version. They exist solely to confuse
                and mislead.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>A Philosophical Reflection on Winning and Letting Go</h2>
            <p>
              In life, there are moments where no matter how hard we try,
              victory remains elusive. The more we struggle, the more we
              entangle ourselves in the web of expectations, desires, and the
              illusion of control. It is in these moments that we confront an
              essential truth: some battles cannot be won, and the pursuit of
              victory becomes a source of suffering.
            </p>

            <p>
              True wisdom lies in recognizing when we are fighting a losing
              battle, not as a sign of defeat, but as an opportunity to
              transcend the need to win. Letting go does not mean giving up;
              rather, it is an act of liberation. It frees us from the chains of
              attachment and the endless cycle of striving for an outcome that
              may never come.
            </p>

            <p>
              By embracing the art of letting go, we discover a deeper form of
              victory—one that is not bound by external success, but rooted in
              inner peace. In letting go, we win by releasing the need to win,
              and in that release, we find true freedom.
            </p>

            <h2>Opportunities for Improvement</h2>
            <p>
              While the current version of the game is entertaining in its own
              right, there are several potential enhancements that could make
              the experience even more enjoyable:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>More "Realistic" Board Generation:</strong> Developing
                an algorithm to generate boards that appear more realistic could
                heighten the initial illusion of fairness, making the eventual
                realization of the game's futility even more satisfying.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Improved Number Generation:</strong> Refining the logic
                behind the numbers on the board to better reflect the placement
                of mines could add another layer of complexity to the deception.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Randomized Loss on 2nd or 3rd Turn:</strong> Introducing
                a randomized loss on the 2nd or 3rd turn could further enhance
                the player's belief that the game isn't rigged, prolonging the
                suspense and teasing them into thinking they might actually
                win—only to dash those hopes once again.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              This parody version of Minesweeper is designed to entertain and
              frustrate in equal measure. The challenge lies not in winning the
              game, but in recognizing the humor behind its unwinnable nature.
              As you play, we hope you enjoy the journey toward the inevitable
              realization: in this game, you simply cannot win.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Happy losing!</strong>
